## For Fun Note

This Project was by far one of the most interesting and challenging things I've had going through this bootcamp with LHL. It made me think and learn in a more effective way. 

This project was so satisfying to complete. From the beginning on making the server file all the way to changing a button tag, this project pushed my limits and made me apply the newly learned concepts from previous weeks. The best feeling is when you understand and when I started this project until I finished it was a journey of understanding.

I can confidently say that this project furthered my understanding of various concepts. As well as being able to read my code and understanding what it does and why. But overall learning how to better organize my code/files so there isn't confusion on how where things are written. It's more of an organized list that's now easy to go through.
